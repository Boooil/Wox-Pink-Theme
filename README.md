# Wox-Pink-Theme
a wox theme with pink and yellow color. Get the color combination for Baidu Tieba, then I do some changes on it.

such as setting `BaseItemHighlightColor`, changing the search box to rounded corners, adding shadows so that make it look more aesthetically pleasing.

## How to use
Download this project, and copy **xaml** files to Wox Theme directory. Wox's data directory usually in `C:\Users\yourusername\AppData\Local\Wox`, go to this folder, you'll find a folder that starts with `app-`, copy **xaml** files into `Themes` folder under `app-`, that's all. 

Then you can open Wox setting, and you'll see these Alfred themes. Enjoy it.
